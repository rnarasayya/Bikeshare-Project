# Bikeshare-Project
This project explores the Bikeshare data about the Capital Bikeshare
system in Washington D.C over a two-year period from 2011 to 2012.
The bikeshare.py file calculates and visualizes correlations between attribues and ridership.
If you download this code, make sure to change the paths so the code runs and the plots are saved correctly.
The bikeshare.py also runs looks for statistically significant differences in the ridership
betwen conditions of interest. It also runs the bikeshare_models.py file.
The bikeshare_models.py file use a KNeighborsRegressor to predict total, casual, and registered ridership.
There is also a file called bikeshare_tests.py which tests the bikeshare_corr_tests and bikeshare_models
functions with a smaller version of the Capital Bikeshare system dataset.
